# Pacman-style game in R

This is the full code for a playable, pacman-style game in R.

The game plays in realtime using 2 key packages:

* [`{nara}`](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/nara) for manipulation of
  *nativeRaster* images as a fast in-memory drawing canvas
* [`{eventloop}`](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/eventloop) for event-driven
  interaction - allowing for keyboard feedback while rendering the game with
  sound.
  
## Gameplay

## Controls

The aim of this pacman-style game is to eat all 288 dots before you lose
your 5 pacman lives.

* Run game with `source('game.R')`
* Control pacman with arrow keys (or WASD).
* Score 10 points for each dot consume.
* Lose 100 points for every collision with a ghost.
* Maximum possible score: 2880 for consume all dots and never colliding with a ghost.
* There are no power-ups. Ghosts cannot die. Every collision with a 
  ghost will take one of your lives.
* The portal between the left and right side of the board, as present on a 
  regular pacman game, is not included here.
  

## Installation

1. Install the dependencies
    * [`{nara}`](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/nara)
    * [`{eventloop}`](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/eventloop)
2. Retrieve the pacman game code from [github](https://github.com/coolbutless/pacman)
    * Note that this is *not* a package, but just a collection of R scripts and
      code.  This should make it easier to hack on, extend and adapt.


```
library(remotes)

# Packages required for interactive rendering
remotes::install_github("coolbutuseless/eventloop")
remotes::install_github("coolbutuseless/nara")

# Grab a copy of the pacman game code
x <- remotes::remote_download(remotes::github_remote('coolbutuseless/pacman'))
untar(x, exdir = 'pacman')
setwd('pacman')
setwd(dir())
source('game.R')
```


## Requirements

**macOS**

Running this on macOS requires [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) to have been 
installed in order to support the `x11()` device.
  
**Linux**

R needs to have been compiled with `x11()` and Cairo support.
  
  
## Limitation - WindowsOS

The WindowsOS version of R does not currently have support for the `onIdle` callback and 
therefore does not support  event-driven interactive graphics as implemented 
in the `{eventloop}` package.

**If you are a windows developor capable of adding support for an `onIdle` callback
to R itself, please get in touch!**

## Limitation - Flickering Cursor

The cursor icon in an `{eventloop}` window will flicker because of some hard-coded
behaviour in R's double-buffered `x11()` graphics device.

`{eventloop}` makes use of the `x11()` graphics device with a double-buffered
backend based on Cairo  (`x11(type = 'dbcairo')`).

The double-buffering within the graphics device is coordinated through use
of `dev.hold()` and `dev.flush()` calls.

Whenever `dev.hold()` is called, the cursor will be set to the busy cursor
(usually a stopwatch on macOS), and when `dev.flush()` is called the 
cursor reverts to a normal pointer arrow.

Since `dev.hold()` and `dev.flush()` are called when drawing every single 
frame, the cursor will flicker between these two images.

The interim solution is to not have the cursor over the window when interacting
with the app.  This only really works when the app solely relies on keyboard
feedback (like this pacman game).

The more complicated solution will involve crafting a patch to R itself to
make the cursor change behaviour user-configurable rather than hard-coded.

**If you are are an R developer capable of crafting such a patch to R ,
please get in touch with me!**
